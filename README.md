# Reinforcement Toys

**This repository proposes an introduction du Q-Learning on some toy exemples**

## Instalation

The notebooks are readable on _GitHUb_ but some features cannot be displayed on the site and it is better to experiment with the algorithms and the parameters.\\
You can directly _clone_ the repository and install the packages listed in the `requirements.txt` file. Here are the commands using `Anaconda`:
```
git clone https://github.com/JbRemy/Reinforcement_Toys
conda create -n <NAME> python=3.7
conda activate <NAME>
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
for osX you might also need to install `ffmpeg`: 
```
brew install ffmpeg
```

## TODO

* Add explration vs exploitation trade-off visualization on the first task
* Add more complex tasks, and algorithms (DeepQ, Lunar lander)
